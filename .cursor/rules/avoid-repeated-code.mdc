# Avoid repeated code

- Prefer reusing existing functions or helpers instead of duplicating logic.
- If two code paths do the same thing (e.g. "focus workspace" and "restore workspace"), use one implementation (e.g. `focusWorkspace`) for both.
- Extract shared logic into a single place; call it from all call sites.
